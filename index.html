                        “Creativity is intelligence and having fun.”

Keeping in mind the above thought, students of Grade V did a CREST Subject enrichment activity wherein they demonstrated— a unique representation of a food chain, Circle booklet on ecosystem or Role play to showcase their awareness about the environment friendly products.

This activity helped them not only to gain conceptual clarity or enrich their subjective knowledge but also boosted their confidence to deliver a presentation with full zeal and enthusiasm even in challenging COVID 19 times.

                            The aim of any exam is to provide a unique competitive platform through and identify the young geniuses and create a talent pool for the future. Olympiads are not just only the exams but they do a lot more to bring out the best in a child, develop a sense of confidence in the students and their parents. These also help parents identify the talent of their child and help school students to test their understanding, level of knowledge and power of reasoning. SOF Olympiad exams were conducted in #Manav Rachna International School, Sec-51, Gurugram targeted to increase students’ efficiency. Six geniuses of the school have got 1st International Position in different Olympiads. It is an honour for the school to have such achievers. They have made the school proud with their remarkable results. We appreciate the hard work and dedication on the part of the children and their parents, and congratulate them for the same.</p>
